# SwiftUI Core Data and Widget Tutorial

Hey there! Welcome to the SwiftUI Core Data and Widget Tutorial! Throughout this tutorial, I've had the opportunity to learn and explore various exciting aspects of SwiftUI to build feature-rich applications. Here's a summary of what I've learned:

## What I've learnedüìù

1. **Integrating Core Data with the SwiftUI App Life Cycle**: I got familiar with Xcode's new Core Data template and learned how to effectively integrate Core Data into SwiftUI apps. It's incredible how this powerful combination can streamline data management.

2. **Creating Basic Widgets**: I discovered how to create Widgets for iPhone and iPad devices, allowing me to present crucial information and provide enhanced user interaction right on the home screen.

3. **Developing a Custom Toggle Style**: It's amazing how I could create my custom toggle style, giving the app a unique look, and even building a custom checkbox ‚Äì exactly matching my app's design.

4. **CRUD Operations with Core Data**: I mastered the essential Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, which gave me full control over managing database items using Core Data.

5. **Light and Dark Mode Appearances**: I learned how to toggle between Light and Dark mode appearances in my SwiftUI app, offering users a seamless experience and enhancing accessibility.

6. **Storing App Appearance with App Storage**: Understanding how to store and manage the app's appearance preferences using the App Storage property was a game-changer.

7. **Setting Up Widgets with Different Sizes**: Learning to set up Widgets in various sizes, including small, medium, and large, provided my users with a more personalized experience.

8. **Previewing Different Widget Sizes**: I explored how to set up and test the different Widget sizes in SwiftUI's Preview environment, ensuring everything looked perfect before deploying.

9. **Creating Visual Effects**: The ability to add visual effects like blurs and color overlays to my SwiftUI app's UI was a delightful experience, making the app look stunning.
